## Technical Context Analysis

### Technology Stack Evaluation
| Component | DOT-V0.1 | DOT-V0.2 | Benefits |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Frontend | React 18 | Next.js 14 | SSR, better SEO, API routes |
| Backend | Node.js/Express | Supabase | Managed infrastructure, built-in auth |
| Database | PostgreSQL (self) | Supabase PostgreSQL | Managed, RLS, real-time |
| Cache | Redis | Supabase Edge Functions | Less infrastructure |
| Auth | JWT custom | Supabase Auth | OAuth, MFA support |
| Deployment | Docker/Railway | Vercel + Supabase | Simpler, auto-scaling |

### Dependency Assessment
1. **Critical Dependencies**
   - Next.js 14.x (stable)
   - Supabase JS Client 2.x
   - TypeScript 5.x
   - React 18.x

2. **UI Framework Decision**
   - Option A: Material-UI (familiar from V0.1)
   - Option B: Tailwind + shadcn/ui (modern, smaller bundle)
   - Recommendation: Tailwind + shadcn/ui for better performance

3. **State Management**
   - Option A: Redux Toolkit (familiar)
   - Option B: Zustand (simpler, smaller)
   - Recommendation: Zustand for this project scale

### Integration Points
1. **Supabase Integration**
   - Database: Direct client access with RLS
   - Auth: Session management with cookies
   - Storage: File uploads for receipts/documents
   - Real-time: WebSocket subscriptions

2. **Vercel Integration**
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Preview deployments for PRs
   - Edge functions for API routes
   - Analytics and monitoring

3. **GitHub Integration**
   - Source control
   - Issue tracking
   - Pull request workflow
   - GitHub Actions for CI

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Supabase free tier limits | Medium | High | Monitor usage, upgrade plan if needed |
| Learning curve for Next.js App Router | Medium | Medium | Use documentation, start simple |
| Data migration complexity | Low | High | Incremental migration, backup strategy |
| Real-time performance | Low | Medium | Optimize subscriptions, use polling fallback |

### Operational Risks
1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Risk: Exposed secrets
   - Mitigation: Use Vercel/Supabase dashboards, never commit .env

2. **Database Security**
   - Risk: Data breaches
   - Mitigation: RLS policies, regular security audits

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Risk: Broken production
   - Mitigation: Preview deployments, rollback strategy

### Migration Strategy from V0.1
1. **Phase 1**: Setup new infrastructure (Week 1)
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate core features (Week 2-3)
3. **Phase 3**: Add enhancements (Week 4)
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and optimization (Ongoing)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up Supabase project and get API keys
3. Configure Vercel deployment
4. Create GitHub repository structure

### Technology Choices
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (performance, modern)
- **State**: Zustand (simplicity)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod (type safety)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright

### Development Workflow
1. Feature branches from main
2. PR with preview deployment
3. Code review required
4. Auto-merge after tests pass
5. Auto-deploy to production

## Success Metrics
- Setup completed within 1 week
- All MCP servers functional
- Local dev environment running
- Successful Vercel deployment
- Basic auth flow working
- Database connected and tested
